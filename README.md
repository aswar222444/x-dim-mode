## 📋 What is x-dim-mode?

x-dim-mode is a simple Chrome extension. It brings back the dim, dark blue background theme on X (formerly Twitter). If you liked the darker look that Twitter once had, this tool restores it for you. It works quietly in the background without changing how you use the site.

This extension is useful if you prefer darker themes for less eye strain or just like the way X looked before. It changes the background only, so your tweets, feeds, and messages stay the same.

## 💻 Who Can Use This?

Anyone who uses Google Chrome or Chromium-based browsers like Microsoft Edge can use this extension. No special skills are needed. You do not have to know coding or website design. Just install it and enable it.

It works even if you use X lightly or a lot. You get a consistent dark blue background experience every time you open X.com.

x-dim-mode only changes the look of X. It does not collect or share any personal data. It does not access your passwords, messages, or other private information. The extension reads only the page’s appearance to modify the background color.

This extension works on desktop browsers only. Mobile browsers on phones or tablets will not support Chrome extensions.

It adapts to X’s current interface, but major site redesigns might affect its function temporarily until an update is released.
